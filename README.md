Photo Studio Administration System aims to provide a centralized, easy-to-use platform for managing all aspects of a photography business, including studio bookings, customer management, package listings, staff schedules, and payment tracking. The system will streamline daily operations, improve customer service, and ensure accurate record-keeping.

Customers can browse available photography packages, check available slots, and make online bookings. Administrators can manage customer records, booking schedules, payments, package details, and promotional offers in real time.

Tech Stack:

- Frontend: React.js with modern UI libraries (e.g., Material UI / TailwindCSS).
  
- Backend: Spring Boot for REST APIs, business logic, and authentication.

- - Database: MySQL for storing bookings, services, staff, and customer records.
